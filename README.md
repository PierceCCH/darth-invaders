# Darth inVaders
Final project for UCLA M152A: Introductory Digital Design Lab

## Background
Space Invaders is a classic arcade game that was first released in 1978. In the game, the player controls a ship that moves horizontally across the bottom of the screen while firing at a group of invading aliens. The aliens move steadily downward, and the player must eliminate all of the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.

In this project, we recreated a simplified version of the game, termed “Darth inVaders”. The game was designed and implemented on an FPGA development board using the Verilog hardware description language. The development board provided the necessary interface for controlling the game using a VGA monitor and buttons on the FPGA board. The game consists of a player-controlled ship that must destroy a wave of incoming alien ships.

## Controls
BTNL/BTNR: Moves ship left and right

BTND: Starts or resets the game

BTNU: Shoots a projectile
